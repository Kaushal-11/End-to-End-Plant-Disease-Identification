                #### About Dataset
                This dataset is recreated using offline augmentation from the original dataset. The original dataset can be found on this [Kaggle repository](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vipoooool/new-plant-diseases-dataset).
                This dataset consists of about 87K RGB images of healthy and diseased crop leaves which are categorized into 38 different classes. The total dataset is divided into an 80/20 ratio of training and validation set preserving the directory structure.
                A new directory containing 33 test images is created later for prediction purposes.
                
                #### Content
                1. train (70295 images)
                2. test (33 images)
                3. validation (17572 images)
                
                #### About CNN Model
                Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is a type of deep learning algorithm that is widely used for image classification tasks. In this project, a CNN model has been trained on the provided dataset to recognize plant diseases from images. The model architecture consists of convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers, enabling it to learn intricate patterns and features from the input images.
                
                The CNN model has been trained using TensorFlow and Keras, popular libraries for building deep learning models. By leveraging the power of CNNs, this system achieves high accuracy in identifying plant diseases, contributing to efficient crop management and disease prevention.
